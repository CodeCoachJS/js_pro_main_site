          These challenges aren’t just coding exercises — they're designed to
          mimic what you’ll actually face as a developer on the job. Learn
          technologies like Webpack, Redux, TypeScript, Unit Testing, and
          Serverless in real-world scenarios that mirror the challenges your
          future team will expect you to solve.
